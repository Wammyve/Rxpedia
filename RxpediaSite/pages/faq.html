                            <p>After clicking the search button on the navigation bar, simply just begin typing
                                the name of a drug you wish to find in the search bar and press Enter.

                            <p>The drug page is simply just a template that gets fed information based on the drug
                                you search up. No redirects, no page hopping!

                            <p>This feature is currently a work in progress and will be available soon! This
                                will be available on the same page where you search up drugs.
                            </p>

                            <p>This feature is currently not a priority at this time. However, in the future
                                we plan on attempting on creating this.

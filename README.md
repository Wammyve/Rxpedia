# Rxpedia
College project. Website that connects to database and displays information about Rx.
This project was created in Visual Studio Code, therefore that should be the same environment that should be used in development, unless specified otherwise.

**Note:** This project will only work as fully intended when started up as an actual server. **Recommended software: [WampServer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/files/WampServer%203/WampServer%203.0.0/).** This is because the project requires a connection to be established to a MySQL database through a PHP script.
